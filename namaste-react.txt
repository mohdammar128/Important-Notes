package-ock.son is very important file
1. It locks the version 
2. Never put it in .gitignore

# We never push node modules to github ,thats why we keep it inside gitignore because its too heavy ,but the question arises that if somebody want to use my code then how he will download nodemodules??
Ans: He will use package-lock.json that is present on the github and install all node module dependencies


#Hot Module Reloading (Parcel will track each library and if there is any changes in any file parcel will automatically shows it when you save it)
Parcel uses fileWatcher algorithm (it is wrriten in C++)
Parcel does Bundeling
Parcel Does Minification
Parcel cleans our code
It is super fast algorithm
Image Optimization
Caching while Develoment 
It does Compressions also
TreeShaking => removing unwanted code
campatible with older version of browsers
Its gives https on dev machine
We should put parcel-cache in gitignore
anything we can genrate on server can be put inside .gitignore file
parcel uses consitent hashing algorithm ,to do caching 
React does not do minification ,parcel does that minification or you can say bundlers



#browserlist make our app compatible with lots of browser

#babel is javaScript package (Think it like balck box)

#bable-plugin-transform-remove to remove console.log

#when we have multiple siblings then i have to give keys(that uniqly identifies) to my each siblings
#JSX uses react.createElement behind the Scene (babel converts the JSX code into React.createElement)
# babel comes along with parcel
#Jsx make sure from Xss attack

#evey component in react maintain some state
# when our state varaible changes then react re-render whole component  (what it does in re rendering ,it delete the component and create again from scracth ,although this process is very fast)

#Reconcilliation is the heart of react

#good way to call apis
loads==> renderpage ==> api call ==>update UI (it is best way)

#never Create component inside Component (We can compose component)

#never write useState inside if ,for loop and never create it outside funtional Component

#can I use more than one useEffect       (yes we can create)

# There are two type of routing (client side routing and server side routing)


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# We can not create ClassBased Component without render() method
#when we change page then use effect return funtion will call ,(this process is known as unmounted)
#React life cycle --> [Constructor calling => rendering => componentDidAmount]

Question  ==> How to create custom Hook??
Question ==> What is lazy loading/chunking/codeSplitting/Dynamic Bundeling/ ??


modularity: it means break our code into meaningful module

where ever we have imports for Instamart there we have to do lazy load

ways to style html (also go through the pros and cons of each styling)
1.Normal Native CSS
2.SCSS
3.inline CSS
4.Component Liabraries -- MUI,ANT,Base UI,Chakra UI
5.Styled Component
6.Tailwind CSS FrameWork













#--------------------------------------------------
1.Handling data is most crucial part in webapp
2.UI layer and Data Layer
- if we have to pass data from one component to another component then  we use props and  its kind of local state of our parent 
- state is local react varaible  (its not common variable like javaScript ,its different ,only react can track it )
-Lets Uderstand (suppose we have to send Data from  AppLayOut to Resturant Card)
    - AppLayOut
       it has [user] state
         -Body is child Component Of AppLayOut ([user ]is passed to body)
            Resturant Card is Child Of Body ([user] is passed from body to Resturant card)

 The above scenario is known as [Props Drilling]

 -We can not modify state of one Sibling componet from another Sibling Componet Directly 
 -We can Play smart game (We can maintain the state in the parent of Siblings) intead of mainting state by each component 

 
 The above two line introduces new Concept that is called [state lifting/ state up lifting]

 -React dev tool Profiler will watch what we will be doing on our website and record it
 -suppose we have a useCase that our data are require by all the components or you can say more than 50% component require that data ,then instead of doing props drilling we have to store our data into a central place ,from where all the componets that require data can easily get it.
 

 so for the above use case we use in react useContext() hook (another alternative is reduxStore but genraaly we use it for complex case)

 -updating localStorage is heavy operation /costly operation
 -createContext() is a funtion which takes arguments as data which we need anywhere in our webapp 
 - We can create more than one context
 - context are not tied to Componet ,where are state and props are tied to Component
 - In class Based Component we used it as Component (etc <UserContext.Consumer></UserContext.Consumer>)
 - you can  modify our context using provider (userContext.Provider)
